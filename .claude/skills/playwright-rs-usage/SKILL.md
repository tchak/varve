# Using playwright-rs

Rust bindings for [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This
crate is a thin JSON-RPC client to the upstream Playwright server, so
the API mirrors playwright-python / java / .NET semantics. When
unsure about a method's behavior, the
[upstream Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/api) are the
authoritative reference.

**Drift discipline.** The canonical API tour lives in the crate-level
rustdoc at <https://docs.rs/playwright-rs> — that's compile-checked
against the actual code. This skill is the "what to reach for, what
to avoid" overlay: durable conventions, not a method-by-method
reference. The one Rust code block below is compile-checked by
`cargo xtask verify-agent-docs`; the rest is prose that ages well
because it talks in concepts (auto-wait, builder pattern) rather
than specific method names.

## Object model

```text
Playwright            start here — Playwright::launch().await?
  └── BrowserType     .chromium() / .firefox() / .webkit()
        └── Browser   .launch().await? → owns the browser process
              └── BrowserContext       isolated cookies / storage
                    └── Page            one tab
                          └── Locator   selector with auto-wait
```

`Locator` is the workhorse. Build with `page.locator(...)` or the
semantic `get_by_*` helpers (`get_by_role`, `get_by_text`, etc. —
see docs.rs for the full list) and chain action / assertion methods.

## Conventions to follow

- **`Result<T>` and `async/await` on `tokio`.** One error type:
  `playwright_rs::Error`. Use `?` to propagate.
- **Builders / setters for option-heavy methods.** `goto`, `click`,
  `screenshot`, `fill`, `tracing().start`, etc. take an `Options`
  struct. These are `#[non_exhaustive]` (so upstream option additions
  stay non-breaking) — struct literals won't compile. Construct with
  the type's `builder()` where it has one, otherwise chain setters off
  `Default`/`new()`: `GetByRoleOptions::default().name("OK").exact(true)`,
  `Cookie::new(name, value).domain("example.com")`. The exact method
  names live on docs.rs; don't memorize them.
- **Auto-wait + auto-retry.** Locator-based actions wait until the
  element is actionable; `expect()` assertions retry until they hold
  or time out. **Never insert `tokio::time::sleep` between an action
  and a check** — that's a smell. If a wait feels necessary, you
  probably want `expect(locator).to_be_visible().await` or similar.
- **`locator!()` macro for literal selectors.** Compile-time validation
  catches typos and structural errors. Fall back to `&str` only for
  selectors computed at runtime.
- **No reimplemented browser protocols.** This crate is intentionally
  thin over the Playwright server. Anything you can't do via Playwright
  itself, you can't do here.

## Minimal test skeleton

This block is compile-checked by `cargo xtask verify-agent-docs` —
if the API drifts, the verifier fails:

```rust,no_run
use anyhow::Result;
use playwright_rs::{Playwright, locator, expect};

#[tokio::test]
async fn login_flow() -> Result<()> {
    let pw = Playwright::launch().await?;
    let browser = pw.chromium().launch().await?;
    let context = browser.new_context().await?;
    let page = context.new_page().await?;

    page.goto("https://example.com/login", None).await?;
    page.locator(locator!("input[name='user']")).fill("alice", None).await?;
    page.locator(locator!("input[name='pass']")).fill("hunter2", None).await?;
    page.locator(locator!("text=Sign in")).click(None).await?;

    expect(page.locator(locator!(".welcome"))).to_be_visible().await?;

    browser.close().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Capabilities worth reaching for

Concept-level pointers; the exact options live on docs.rs.

- **Stable / redacted screenshots.** `ScreenshotOptions` carries
  `animations(Disabled)` for flake-free shots (freeze CSS animations
  before capture) and `mask`/`mask_color` to overpaint dynamic or
  sensitive elements. Reach for `animations(Disabled)` whenever a
  screenshot races an animation.
- **Context-level events.** Beyond per-page handlers, `BrowserContext`
  observes activity across *all* its pages — `on_download`,
  `on_page_load` / `on_page_close`,
  `on_frame_attached` / `_detached` / `_navigated` — and
  `Browser::on_context` fires for each new context. Use these for
  multi-tab fixtures instead of wiring every page individually.
- **HAR network capture.** `tracing().start_har(path, ..)` /
  `stop_har()` records all network traffic to a HAR — inspect it in
  browser devtools or replay it deterministically with
  `route_from_har`. A sibling to trace capture.
- **Typed page probes.** `page.evaluate::<R, T>(expr, arg)`
  deserializes the JS return value straight into any serde
  `Deserialize` type — define a struct for the shape and skip manual
  parsing (`None::<&()>` for the no-argument case). `evaluate_value`
  (returns `String`) is only for one-off scalar probes; if you catch
  yourself returning delimited strings from JS and splitting them in
  Rust, switch to `evaluate`. Runnable walkthroughs:
  `examples/evaluate_typed.rs` and `examples/canvas_pixels.rs` (canvas
  pixel assertions for wasm/canvas frontends).
- **Drags: `Locator::drag_to` covers everything, including canvas.**
  It drives the real `pointerdown` → capture → `pointermove` →
  `pointerup` chain (works against `setPointerCapture` UIs), and
  `DragToOptions::target_position` — an offset from the target's
  top-left — turns it into "drag to a coordinate": pass the containing
  canvas/stage as the target. Prefer it over held-button
  `Mouse::move_to` sequences, which hang on headless Linux. Don't
  hand-roll synthetic `PointerEvent` dispatch via evaluate.
- **External drag-and-drop.** `Locator::drop` simulates dragging files
  or data in from outside the page (upload zones), distinct from
  `drag_to`, which drags one element onto another within the page.
- **File System Access API flows.** `page.fake_file_system()` installs
  an opt-in fake of `showSaveFilePicker`/`showOpenFilePicker` (native
  dialogs no automation tool can drive): seed opens with
  `set_open_file`, assert saves with `last_saved_bytes()`, control
  permission state. Don't hand-roll an `add_init_script` picker shim.
- **Accessibility-tree assertions.** `expect_page(&page)
  .to_match_aria_snapshot(..)` (and the locator form) guard the page's
  ARIA structure as a regression check; `aria_snapshot` can emit
  `[box=..]` bounding boxes for visual/agent reasoning.

- **Waiting on arbitrary state: `wait_for_function`.** When there is no
  selector to wait on — a JS flag, a store, a counter —
  `page.wait_for_function("() => window.app?.ready", None)` polls a
  predicate and resolves to its value as a `JSHandle`. The locator form
  binds the matched element as the first argument
  (`locator.wait_for_function("el => el.dataset.state === 'done'", None)`)
  and returns `()`. Prefer this over `poll_until`-around-`evaluate`
  loops: the driver polls on `requestAnimationFrame` and enforces the
  timeout. `WaitForFunctionOptions::polling_interval` switches to timer
  polling (page-global form only).
- **Calling back into Rust: `evaluate_with_callback`.** Hands the
  expression a Rust closure as its argument — JS calls it, the
  arguments come to Rust, and the closure's return value resolves the
  JS promise. The expression may stash the function for later (event
  listeners); the binding lives until the page closes, so register once
  rather than in a loop. For a permanently installed `window.fn`, use
  `expose_function`/`expose_binding` instead.
- **Session save & replay.** `context.storage_state(None)` captures
  cookies and per-origin storage;
  `StorageStateOptions::default().credentials(true).indexed_db(true)`
  additionally captures WebAuthn passkeys and IndexedDB.
  `set_storage_state(state)` restores into any context — a **replace**,
  not a merge: the driver clears storage for every visited origin, and
  restoring a state without `credentials` disposes an installed virtual
  authenticator. The fast path for "log in once, reuse everywhere".
- **Opting out of auto-scroll.** Pointer actions scroll the target into
  view before acting; `ClickOptions::builder().scroll(Scroll::None)`
  makes the action fail instead — the way to assert something is
  *already* visible, or to avoid scroll side effects.

## Debugging failures with traces

Rust has no async `Drop`, so trace cleanup is **explicit**. The
canonical pattern: capture the test result, run cleanup
unconditionally, pass the trace path only on failure.

See [`examples/trace_on_failure.rs`](https://github.com/padamson/playwright-rust/blob/main/crates/playwright/examples/trace_on_failure.rs)
for the runnable end-to-end version — it's compiled by
`cargo check --examples` so it can't silently rot.

To view a captured trace: `playwright show-trace trace.zip`. The
viewer is language-agnostic — same UI JS / Python users see. The
hosted version is at <https://trace.playwright.dev>.

## Programmatic trace inspection

For CI bots, agent feedback loops, or any code that wants to read what
happened in a trace without re-running the test, add the companion
crate as a `[dev-dependencies]` entry: `playwright-rs-trace = "0.1"`.

Use `TraceReader::actions()` to walk the reassembled action stream,
`TraceReader::network()` for HTTP traffic. The crate's `//!`
rustdoc on <https://docs.rs/playwright-rs-trace> has a runnable
example.

## Things that look like playwright-python but aren't quite

- **No `sync_playwright`.** Async only; everything awaits on `tokio`.
- **`Result`, not exceptions.** Use `?` to propagate.
- **No keyword arguments.** Options come through `Options` structs with
  `..Default::default()`, not `name=value` in method calls.
- **No async `Drop`.** Always close browsers / stop tracing explicitly
  in a cleanup block — don't rely on RAII for I/O.
- **Locators are values, not lazy proxies.** `page.locator(...)`
  returns a `Locator` you can `.clone()` and re-use cheaply.
- **Functions cannot ride inside evaluate args.** Python passes
  callables directly; here the callback is a dedicated parameter
  (`evaluate_with_callback`) since serialized data cannot carry a Rust
  closure.

## Common pitfalls

- **Manual sleeps before assertions.** Use `expect(..)` and let it
  auto-retry.
- **Closing the browser before `tracing.stop()`** — traces are written
  on stop, so order matters: stop tracing first, then close.
- **Hardcoding selectors as `&str`.** Switch to `locator!()` for any
  selector you write as a literal.

## Local (varve) conventions

Copied verbatim from upstream `padamson/playwright-rust` at v0.16.0
(Apache-2.0) — everything above this section is theirs; re-copy on a
version bump. Local rules for this repo:

- `playwright-rs` is an exact-pinned dev-dependency of `platform-app`
  only; e2e tests are one binary, `platform/platform-app/tests/e2e/`,
  split by SUBJECT (journeys, not pages): `harness.rs` holds the
  shared machinery; each other module is one subject (`auth.rs`,
  `i18n.rs`, ...). A new subject = a new module; anything two subjects
  need goes in the harness. Filter with `cargo test --test e2e
  auth::`.
- Browsers install once via
  `cargo run -p platform-app --example install-browsers -- chromium`
  (the vendored example; versions ride Cargo.lock — never
  `npx playwright install` by hand).
- Tests are double-gated (P.3 convention): `VARVE_TEST_DATABASE_URL`
  set AND chromium installed (`Error::BrowserNotInstalled` at launch
  is the sanctioned probe — there is no is_installed() API). On a
  miss, print `skipped: ...` and pass vacuously.
- Serve the app in-process (`topcoat::serve_until` on an ephemeral
  port); never shell out to `cargo run`. Unique emails per test;
  fresh browser context per test; no global-count assertions.
- Assert via locators/roles, not raw HTML; keep French assertions
  aware of U+00A0/U+202F (substring-match around them).
- Multi-engine: e2e tests run every installed engine (chromium,
  firefox, webkit probed via `BrowserNotInstalled`). Known divergence,
  confirmed 2026-08-21: **WebKit refuses `Secure`/`__Host-` cookies
  over `http://127.0.0.1`** (stores nothing); Chromium and Firefox
  extend the trustworthy-loopback carve-out to cookies. Encode
  per-engine expectations explicitly (see `accepts_secure_cookie_on_
  loopback_http` in tests/e2e.rs) — never weaken an assertion for the
  engines that do accept.
- When driving the app manually via the Playwright MCP browser,
  save screenshots into `.playwright-mcp/` (gitignored; it is an
  allowed MCP root) — never at the repo root.
